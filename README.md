## What is this?
This is a personal project where for the next 30 days, I will challenge myself to code cool mobile user interfaces in ionic. I will post my progress here at the end of every single day.

### Day 1: 
Setup the project.
To start the project, I am thinking of creating a splash screen text effect like this one inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JBuHh1HIAA&feature=youtu.be).

Progress at the end of first day:

#### Menu Screen:
