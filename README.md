## What is this?
This is a personal project where I will challenge myself to code cool mobile user interfaces in ionic.

Project hosted at (current progress): https://ui-challenge-site.herokuapp.com/

### Example 1: 
To start the project, I am thinking of creating a splash screen text effect like this one inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JBuHh1HIAA&feature=youtu.be).
